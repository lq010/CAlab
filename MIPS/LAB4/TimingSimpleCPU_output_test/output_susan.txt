Usage: susan <in.pgm> <out.pgm> [options]

-s : Smoothing mode (default)
-e : Edges mode
-c : Corners mode

See source code for more information about setting the thresholds
-t <thresh> : Brightness threshold, all modes (default=20)
-d <thresh> : Distance threshold, smoothing mode, (default=4) (use next option instead for flat 3x3 mask)
-3 : Use flat 3x3 mask, edges or smoothing mode
-n : No post-processing on the binary edge map (runs much faster); edges mode
-q : Use faster (and usually stabler) corner mode; edge-like corner suppression not carried out; corners mode
-b : Mark corners/edges with single black points instead of black with white border; corners or edges mode
-p : Output initial enhancement image only; corners or edges mode (default is edges mode)
